Problem 1:
Suppose there are two roads,
Road 1: ABC Road, represented by equation 5x + y - 3 = 0
Road 2: XYZ Road, represented by equation 2x + 3y + 1 = 0
These two roads meet each other at a chowk, called 123 Chowk.
Determine at which angle , these two roads meet each other at chowk.
What you have to do :
Create a Program which determines angle at which these roads meet at 123 Chowk.


Problem 2:

Project 3: Problem Statement 2
Saurabh Sir stays in Bhopal,
Prateek Sir stays in Bangalore.
Using GPS:
Latitude and Longitude values of Bhopal as 23.259933 N, 77.412613 E.
Latitude and Longitude values of Bangalore as 12.9716 N, 77.5946 E.
Calculate distance between Saurabh Sir and Prateek Sir.


Problem 3:

Looking at an above image, actually that image is zoomed up version of pdf file.

As we see there is ‘A’ shaped character, it has three vertices which has coordinates

Project 3: Problem Statement 3
(20.077,
11.598) , (26.526, 90.138) , (23.674, 32.579).

We have to cover the area under ‘A’ shaped character and colour it black.
Calculate area under ‘A’ shaped character
